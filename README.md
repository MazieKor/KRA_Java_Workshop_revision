Simple task manager with some options.

Please note, that the final (with most functionalities) version of the Task Manager is in package "TaskManagerUpgraded".
Purpose of this exercise was to create TaskManager with relatively simple means (so, console application, in only one class, without e.g. using database or Java 8). Nevertheless there were some functionalities of java.io (but not java.nio.file) or apache common lang (ArrayUtils, StringUtils, NumberUtils) used.

# More detailed description will be soon added.
